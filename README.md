# sitecore-nine-utilities

**Support for versions of Sitecore and its modules/package as below**

- Sitecore 9.1.1 - XP0
- Sitecore PowerShell Extension 4.7 for 8/9 (aka SPE)
- Sitecore Sitecore Experience Accelerator 1.8.1 for 9.1.1 (aka SXA)
- Sitecore Commerce 9.1 Initial Release

**Here are the special things that I'd bring into here**

- Install OpenJdk; add **JAVA_HOME** and update **PATH** system variables
- Install Solr as a Window Service; enable SSL with `pfx` certificate (preceding, we use `jks` certificate that is generated by javatool)
- Enable SSL (https) for main site by default
- Using wildcard certificates
    - `*.dev.local` for main site, xconnect and identityserver, solr
    - `*.engine.local` for Sitecore Commerce Engine services
- Use Sitecore Azure Toolkit to convert SPE & SXA to Sitecore Webdeploy Package (`*.scwdp.zip` file); then automatically install them
- All of Sitecore Commerce Engine services are identified by hosts name instead of port as original
- Don't use Window Local User (hence no **CSFndRuntimeUser** anymore); instead use **ApplicationPoolIdentity** and **sa**
